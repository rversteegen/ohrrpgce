#DEFINE GFX_BI

' NOTE:
'  If a function is marked as optional, that means it may do nothing (either unimplemented
'  to irrelevant to the backend) and that a backend doesn't need to set the function pointer:
'  instead the pointer must be valid and set to a default in set_default_gfx_function_ptrs.
'  On the other hand "(optional, ptr may be NULL)", means the default is a NULL pointer.
'  Possibly-NULL function pointers are very much discouraged. They're used as a simple way
'  to indicate whether the function is implemented, or where calling an unimplemented function
'  would be an unnecessary performance hit.
