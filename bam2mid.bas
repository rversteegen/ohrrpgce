'' bam2mid -- convert a .BAM file to a General Midi .MID file
''		2005-10-11 - 1.0 - Ignores final infinite loop point and
''						   sets velocity to 64. Don't know if that
''						   is good or bad.
''
'' usage: bam2mid <infile> [<outfile>]
'' <outfile> defaults to <infile>.mid if not specified.
''
'' To compile:
''        fbc -lang deprecated bam2mid.bas
