PLEASE ALWAYS READ THIS FILE AFTER YOU DOWNLOAD A NIGHTLY BUILD!
We would like to be able to ASSUME that you do!

This file holds important news that people who use unstable versions need to
know. It'll be included with stable releases (for people upgrading from
nightlies) and then wiped clean again, so ignore it if you haven't used a
nightly build.

The developers will occasionally update it with information about new bugs;
things that have changed in a non-compatible way; things you need to do or
not do after upgrading; and unfinished features.

For more information ask on the mailing list:

2009-09-24:
We have just realised that (all versions of) Custom did not warn if an RPG is
in a new format that it does not fully support! If you downgrade your Custom
version, you'll get no warning if you're about to scramble some data! In
particular, games edited with recent nightlies and then with Xocolatl+2 will
suffer attack data corruption.

2009-10-20:
The new script error screen will now pop up for all slice scripting errors,
possibly interrupting your previously apparently-working game.

If you edited your text boxes with any build from 2974 to 2982 your text boxes
will be corrupted. The bug was fixed in revision 2983
