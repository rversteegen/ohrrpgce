*** PLEASE ALWAYS READ THIS FILE AFTER YOU DOWNLOAD A NIGHTLY BUILD! ***
***         We would like to be able to ASSUME that you do!          ***

This file holds important news that people who use unstable versions need to
know. It'll probably be included with stable releases (for people upgrading
from nightlies), so ignore it if you haven't used a nightly build. Entries
for old versions are archived at the bottom of the file.

The developers will occasionally update it with information about new bugs,
things that have changed in a non-compatible way, things you need to do or
not do after upgrading, and unfinished features.

2010-11-11:
Note that gfx_directx does not currently support the newly added scancodes;
check back in a few days!

2010-10-17:
The default graphics backend on Windows is now gfx_directx instead of gfx_sdl
so please, please report any problems -- even minor annoyances!

2010-07-03:
One of the bugs (now fixed) in the new save files wiped the gameover and
loadgame script settings when loading a save. This means if you've saved a
game, reloaded it and then saved again, your gameover and loadgame scripts will
no longer be run, permanently. To fix an existing save you will have to turn on
the "Don't save gameover/loadgame script IDs" general bitset, and then load and
resave your saved games. It normally doesn't matter if you don't turn it off
afterwards.

2010-06-11:
New RSAV format for savegames is now used by default. When you save it still
also save sin the old format. if you need to load from the old format for
some reason, just hold SHIFT while you load.

2010-04-29:
"trace value" requires HSpeak 3L; download a nightly HSpeak build if desired

*** 2010-02-08 Ypsiliform+2 released ***

*** 2010-01-24 Ypsiliform+1 released ***

*** 2010-01-08 Ypsiliform released ***

2009-12-27:
"reset game" no longer behaves identically to "game over" when not both the
titlescreen and load menu are disabled. Instead it always starts a new
game (without showing title or load screens)

2009-12-05:
The old "place sprite", unlike the other sprite commands, could be used on
slices as well as sprites. This is now an error, but will only affect you
when you recompile your scripts. Use "put slice" instead.

2009-10-20:
The new script error screen will now pop up for all slice scripting errors,
possibly interrupting your previously apparently-working game.

If you edited your text boxes with any build from 2974 to 2982 your text boxes
will be corrupted. The bug was fixed in revision 2983

2009-09-24:
We have just realised that (all versions of) Custom did not warn if an RPG is
in a new format that it does not fully support! If you downgrade your Custom
version, you'll get no warning if you're about to scramble some data! In
particular, games edited with recent nightlies and then with Xocolatl+2 will
suffer attack data corruption.

2009-05-14: (Backdated!)
Old command "set sprite visible" still exists but is now just an alias for
"set slice visible".
