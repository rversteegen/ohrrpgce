Capt'n Squiddy's Bootleg PUSH-PUSH
----------------------------------

This is a clone of the puzzle game "Push-Push" found on several models of
Samsung portable phones. The graphics are original, but the levelsets
are a duplicated from the official phone version. Push-Push is a variant
of the puzzle game "Sokoban". For more information about Push-Push, visit
http://how.to/pushpush/

This game was implemented using HamsterSpeak plotscripting in the
O.H.R.RPG.C.E. For more information about the OHRRPGCE, visit

Capt'n Squiddy's Bootleg PUSH-PUSH is free. You may freely redistribute
it as long as you do not misrepresent its origins. You may freely modify
the game as long as you give proper credit (to me, to Samsung)
It is entirely possible that the level data belongs to Samsung. I do not
know if they created original levels, or if they copied levels from an
existing Sokoban implementation.
