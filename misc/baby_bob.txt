Baby Bob is a little demo of plotscripting a side-scroller in the OHRRPGCE
I intend to incorporate Baby Bob into Wandering Hamster as a mini-game at
some point, but I thought it would be a good idea to publish a simple
minimal stripped-down version of the script to help scripters understand
it more easily without having to search through all the other unrelated
plotscripts in Wandering Hamster.

Anyone is welcome to use side-scroll.hss as a base to build their own side
scrolling game, but of course, please do not use the graphics in
Baby_Bob.rpg as those are the same ones I intend to add to Wandering
Hamster.

This script is sufficient to make a character walk around in a
side-scrolling manner with gravity and jumping, but there are many more
things that must be done to make a full featured game from it.

Enjoy!
