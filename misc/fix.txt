These are two utilities for repairing RPG files for the OHRRPGCE

RPGFIX.EXE   Upgrades an obsolete RPG to the latest format without
             needing to know the file's password (note that if you
             know the password, you can use CUSTOM.EXE to upgrade
             the RPG file)

LUMPFIX.EXE  Attempts to repair a corrupt RPG file
