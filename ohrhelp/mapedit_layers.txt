This screen lets you choose a default tileset, and lets you customize each map layer.

Press left and right to change values, or you can type in tileset numbers. Press ENTER to enable or disable a layer.

Each map can have 3 layers, numbered 0 to 2.

Layer 0 is the bottom layer. it goes underneath everything else.

Layer 1 goes underneath heroes and NPCs, but it is transparent. Layer 0 will be visible underneath layer 1.

Layer 2 is also transparent. It goes above heroes and NPCs. You might use it for tree-tops, or stone arches, or the upper parts of walls.

Each layer can optionally have its own tileset, or you can just choose one tileset for the whole map.

It is also possible to make certain layers invisble in the editor, in case you want to work on just one layer at a time without the visual distraction of seeing the other layers. This doesn't affect playing the game; to hide a layer in-game, disable it. Disabling a layer doesn't delete it.
