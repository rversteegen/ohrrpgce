This screen lets you choose a default tileset, and lets you customize each map layer.

Use the up and down arrows to navigate the menu, and press left and right to change values, or you can type in tileset numbers.

Each map can have 3 layers, numbered 0 to 2.

Layer 0 is the bottom layer. it goes underneath everything else.

Layer 1 goes underneath heroes and NPCs, but it is transparent. Layer 0 will be visible underneath layer 1.

Layer 2 is also transparent. It goes above heroes and NPCs. You might use it for tree-tops, or stone arches, or the upper parts of walls.

Each layer can optionally have its own tileset, or you can just choose one tileset for the whole map.

It is also possible to disable certain layers in the editor, in case you want to work on just one layer at a time without the visual distraction of seeing the other layers.
