Use the arrow keys to move around the map.

Use SHIFT+arrow keys to move around the map faster.

Use ALT+arrow keys to move the view of the map.

Press the SPACE bar to place a door. If the door with the selected number already exists, it will be moved.

If you want to remove a door, position the cursor over it and press SPACE again.

You can press < and > or type a number to set the current door number, and if that door already exists the cursor will jump to it. Normally an unused door number is automatically selected.

To link a door to another door, position the cursor over the door and press ENTER. This will take you to the door linking tool.

Remember that for a door to be usable in both directions, it needs to be linked from both directions. If you only link a door one way, it will only be usable one way.

CTRL+S immediately saves, useful when live-previewing a game.

TAB toggles a blue rectangle that shows roughly what area of the map you are currently looking at.

~ shows a preview of the entire map.
