There is a reason that the script debugger was not officially announced.

You might find a little more help on the "Script Debugger" wiki page.
Please ignore Depth/State/CmdKn/CmdID.
F10 to exit. Press V to toggle view mode. The default, script state view, shows the currently running command.
Change selected script with pageup/pagedown. Depending on view mode, press +/- to scroll globals and locals (no editing).
    Stepping commands (buggy):
Press S to step through part of a command; N to continue running until the current script changes; select a script and press U to run until that script is returned to.
Pressing P lets you continue to play the game; in this mode unrecognised keys cause the game to unpause for one tick, and are passed to the game.
