The map editor is in Foe mapping mode (also known as "Foemap mode").

Foe mapping allows you to specify where random battles can happen. Whenever the hero walks on a tile with a foe map number, the player has a chance of encountering a random battle. The number is the same as the Formation Set ID number from the Formation Set Editor. Only one formation set can be assigned to each tile.
