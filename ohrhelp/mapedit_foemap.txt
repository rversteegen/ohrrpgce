Foe mapping allows you to specify where random battles can happen. Whenever the hero walks on a tile with a foe map number, the player has a chance of encountering a random battle.

The number is the same as the Formation Set ID number from the Formation Set Editor.

Press < and > to change the current formation number, or type in a number.

Press SPACE to mark the tile under the cursor so that random battles from the selected formation set can happen there.

To remove random battles from a tile, change the formation set number to 0 and press the SPACE bar on the tile.

Press CTRL+F to fill the screen with the currently selected formation number.
