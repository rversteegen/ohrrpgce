You can choose a background color that will be drawn behind the text. Press ENTER or SPACE to browse for a color.

Where the background is drawn depends on font settings. Non-outlined font by default has two pixels between lines.

The area covered by the background color is slightly different (two pixels wider) than the size of the text slice. The text slice size doesn't include the background.
