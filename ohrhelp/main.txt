Welcome to the OHRRPGCE!

You can press F1 on any menu to see a help screen like this one.

Use the up and down arrow keys to scroll through long help screens.

This is the help for the main menu. Use the Up and Down arrow keys (or PgUp, PgDn, Home and End) to navigate through the menu. Press ENTER or SPACE to choose a menu option. Remember that you can press ESC to exit any submenu and get back to the previous menu. Pressing ESC on the main menu allows you to save (or not) and quit.

On this menu you can also select a menu option by typing the first letter of one of the words in the menu option. For example pressing F switches between Edit Battle Formations and Edit Font.
