This is the Font Editor.

You can export your font as an OHF file, or import a new font from OHF files that you download from other people.

The OHF font format is only used by the OHRRPGCE. There is no way to import other font formats like TrueType TTF.

The 224 characters in the font are a small portion of the Unicode set, which can be typed in the usual way for your system. You can also insert characters from your font by pressing CTRL+SPACE in any text input field, or hitting the key combination (for USA keyboards) shown at the bottom of the screen while drawing the font.

You can set the type of your font as based on either (7-bit) ASCII or Latin-1. This setting affects the export of textboxes and item, attack, etc. names in .HSI files. It indicates which characters are icons you've drawn rather than standard letters. Icons will be exported either as escaped codes that look like \250 for textboxes, or removed entirely in .HSI files.
