Use the arrow keys to navigate.

Press ENTER or SPACE to start editing a sprite.

Press ESC to go back to the main graphics menu.

If you want to add a new spriteset, go to the last sprite set at the bottom and press the down arrow.

You can change the default palette for a sprite set using the [ and ] keys.

CTRL+C copies a sprite.
CTRL+V pastes a sprite.

You can switch to full-spriteset mode by pressing CTRL+F. Full-spriteset mode is important because it allows you to import an entire spriteset from a single file.
