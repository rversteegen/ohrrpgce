The alignment setting controls which edge of this slice's parent the slice will be positioned relative to.

Remember, alignment is relative to the parent slice.

Any padding that the parent slice has affects the position of the alignment point.

In case of a tie when calculating the center of an edge or slice (ie. when width/height is even), the bottom-right point is preferred.
