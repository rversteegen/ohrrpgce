Here you can browse for a BMP file to import as a sprite, for example, a sprite that you drew in an external graphics editor.

Sprites should be saved in BMP format with 4-bit color (that is 16 colors)

The browser will show you the bit-depth of any BMP file you highlight, so you can easily identify any file that will fail to import because it was saved.

The correct pixel size for each sprite type is as follows:

32x40  Hero battle pictures
34x34  Small enemies
50x50  Medium enemies
80x80  Large enemies
20x20  Walkabouts
50x50  Attacks
24x24  Weapons
16x16  Box borders

Also, if you are in full-spriteset mode (CTRL+F on the sprit list)  you can import an entire sprite set from a single file. here are the sizes for sprite sets:

256x40  Hero battle picture sets
160x20  Walkabout sets
150x50  Attack sets
48x24   Weapon sets
256x16  Box border sets

Note that you are allowed to import files that don't exactly match the correct sprite size. If the BMP is too big, the right and bottom edges will be cropped. If the BMP is too small, the right abd bottom edges will be padded with empty space.
