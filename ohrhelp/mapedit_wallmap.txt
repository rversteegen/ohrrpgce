While you are in passability mode, you will see thick flashing lines that indicate where walls are located.

Press SPACE to make the tile under the cursor fully impassable in all four directions. Press SPACE again to remove the walls and make the tile passable.

CTRL+Up makes the selected tile impassable on the top.

CTRL+Down makes the selected tile impassable on the bottom.

CTRL+Left makes the selected tile impassable on the left side.

CTRL+Right makes the selected tile
impassable on the right side.

H marks the tile as a harm tile that can damage the hero when the player steps on it.

A marks the tile as special for Airships (or other vehicle or scripting purposes)

B marks the tile as special for Boats (or other vehicle or scripting purposes)

O marks the tile as overhead. This is obsolete. You should use Layer 2 in Tilemapping mode instead if you want make tiles overhead.
