This is the Font Editor, in drawing mode.

Use the arrow keys to highlight a font character, and press ENTER or SPACE to start editing it.

While editing a font character, use the arrow keys to select pixels and press SPACE to toggle them off and on, or hold SPACE down and press arrows to draw strokes. You can use the left mouse button to turn pixels on, and the right mouse button to erase pixels.

When you are finished, press ENTER or ESC.

It is generally a good idea to leave the right and bottom rows of pixels blank to prevent characters in strings of text from running together.

Aside from typing them directly, you can also insert characters from your font by pressing CTRL+SPACE in any text input field, or hitting the key combination (only correct for US keyboards, sorry!) shown at the bottom of the screen.

You can press CTRL-S to immediately save changes, which can be useful while using Test Game to live preview font edits.
