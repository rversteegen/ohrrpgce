Here you can pick default music and sound effects for a variety of different uses throughout your game.

Navigate the menu with the Up and Down arrow keys (or PgUp, PgDn, Home, and End), or type part of a menu item to jump to it.

Choose songs and sound effects by number, either by using the Left and Right arrow keys or by typing the number in.

The songs and sound effects must already be imported through their respective importers accessed from the Main Menu.
