This is the slice editor.

Actually, it isn't really useful for much of anything right now :(

But in the future it will be usable to create your own custom screen layouts, and to provide a much greater level of customizability for things like the battle interface, the status menu, the spells menu, or shops.

You are welcome to play around with it right now to get an idea of what it is capable of. Please report any bugs you find.

Press + to add a new slice.

Once you have added a slice it will be added to the list. You should add several slices so you can get a feel for how they interact with each other in terms of layering and positioning.

Press ENTER or SPACE to edit a slice's details.

Hold the SHIFT key and use the arrow keys to reorder the slice in the slice list. Moving it to the top of the list makes it draw first. Moving it to the bottom of the list makes it draw last, over the top oof the other slices.

Hold shift and press the left and right arrow keys to change the parentage of a slice. If a slice is indented that means it is a child of the slice right above it in the menu.

Child slices are grouped together with their parent, and they move as a group.
