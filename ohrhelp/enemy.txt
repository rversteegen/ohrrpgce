This is the enemy editor.  In general, any character/active "thing" present in a battle (besides the heroes) must be defined as an enemy.

Use the up and down arrow keys to navigate through the menu.

Use the left and right arrow keys to change which enemy you are editing.

You can also hold the ALT key and type an enemy ID number.

In this menu you can type in a name for your enemy, or press ENTER or SPACE to access the various sub-menus.
