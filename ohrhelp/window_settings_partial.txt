This menu lets you set the in-game window size.
Tip: You can change these settings while using the Test Game option to see the effects live!

Default window size: This lets you adjust roughly how large your game window appears on the screen by default. Depending on the graphics backend in use the player may also be able to change the window size themselves (this is the case on Windows and Mac OSX). The scaling/zoom factor for the window (how large a single pixel appears) is then selected to get as close to your setting as possible.
Note that the size is a percentage width or height of the screen, not area. 10% screen width and height is only 1% the screen area!

Test-Game window size: This setting is used instead of "Default window size" when using the Test Game option, so that you can set a more convenient smaller window size.
