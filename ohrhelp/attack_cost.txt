MP Cost: This is the number of magic points the attacker must spend to use the attack.

HP Cost: This is how much self-damage the attacker does when using the attack. A positive number does damage, a negative number cures.

Gold Cost: If the attack is used by the hero, this is the amount of money the party will lose. A positive number loses money, and a negative number gains money. This has no effect when used by an enemy.

Item 1,2,3: Here yu can specify up to 3 items that are required for this attack to be used. You can think of these items as "Ammunition" for the attack

Item Cost: For each item, specify a number of items required. This should be a positive number for ammunition. For example, you might make a "Crossbow" attack that requires 1 arrow for each time it is used. You can also use a negative number, and the attack will give you that many items. For example, you could make a "Shotgun" attack that requires 2 "Shell" items for each attack, but gives you back 2 "Casing" items eah time you use it. You can then sell the empty casings when you get to a store.
