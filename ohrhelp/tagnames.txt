This is the tag browse screen. Here you can pick a tag from the list by name. Just use the arrow keys to navigate the list.

You can type names for your tags here too! It is a very good idea to name all the tags that you use, that way you can easily keep track of what each tag means.

Tags are switches that can be OFF or ON, and different things can happen depending on the state of a tag. You can use them to keep track of people you have already talked to, or boss monsters that you have already defeated, or quests that are available to you.

To make the list of tags longer, just type a name for the last tag at the bottom of the list. That will automatically make the list grow longer.
