This is the Menu Editor. The translucent menu that fills the screen is used for editing your menu. Behind it is a preview of the in-game menu that you are customizing.

Use the Up and Down arrow keys (or PgUp, PgDn, Home, and End) to navigate.

To change which menu you are working on, select "Menu #" and press the Left and Right arrow keys or type a menu ID number. If you press the right arrow while the last menu is selected, you will be prompted to add a new menu.

Name: This is a name for the menu. It is only for your reference, and is not displayed in-game.

Edit Items: Press ENTER or SPACE to edit the menu items that appear in the menu.

Background: Background box style. There are onlly 15 choices (0-14), but you can change them in the Graphics Editor under User Interface Colors.

Text Color: Press ENTER or SPACE for a color browser.

Max rows to display: Reduce this number to make a long box scroll.

Edit Bitsets: Press ENTER or SPACE to go to a list of OFF/ON bitsets that configure various aspects of box display and behaviour.

 *"Translucent Box"

 *"Never show scrollbar"

 *"Allow gameplay & scripts"
  If this is turned on then the menu
  will NOT pause the rest of the
  game. The player will still be able
  to walk around. NPCs will still
  move. Random battles can still
  happen. Scripts will still run.

 *"Suspend player even if gameplay
  allowed" - This only matters if the
  "Allow gameplay & scripts" bitset
  is on. Turning this bitset on
  causes the hero to be paused while
  the menu is active, but other
  activity like NPCs and scripts may
  continue.

 *"No Box"

 *"Cancel button doesn't close menu"
  Use this if the menu is an
  always-up display, or if you prefer
  to close it using the "close menu
  when selected" bitset on one of the
  items in the menu.

 *"No player control of menu"
  This is useful for menus that are
  controlled by scripts.

 *"Prevent main menu activation"
  Stops the player from opening the
  main menu as long as this menu is
  active. This is useful for
  sub-menus called from the main
  menu.

 *"Advance text box when menu closes"

Border Size: Use this to enlarge or shrink the empty space around the margin on all sides of the menu. Press - to switch between a negative or positive value.
