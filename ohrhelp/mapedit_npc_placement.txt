Two numbers are displayed on each NPC you place. The top number is the NPC's ID, and the bottom number is the NPC's copy-number. You may need the ID and copy number if you want to manipulate the NPC using plotscripting.

Moving the cursor over an NPC displays the movement and avoidance zones for the NPC, if any, in two different colours.
