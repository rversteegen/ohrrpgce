This is the main map menu. Use the arrow keys (or PgUp, PgDn, Home, and End) to navigate the menu, and press ENTER or SPACE to choose a menu item. See the various help files in each sub-menu for more info.

At the bottom of the menu you can type in a name for the map.

Use "Erase Map Data" and "Re-load Default Passability" only with caution. It cannot be undone, so make a backup copy of your RPG file first if you are not certain.
