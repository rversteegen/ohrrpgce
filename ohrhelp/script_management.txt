The script management menu allows you to access some tasks and tools related to your Plotscripts. (Check the documentation wiki at http://HamsterRepublic.com/ohrrpgce/ if you want to learn more about plotscripting)

* "Export names for scripts (.hsi)"
  creates or updates a list of names
  (constants) that you can use while
  writing your scripts.

* "Import compiled plotscripts (.hs)"
  import a file of compiled scripts
  produced by HSpeak. This overwrites
  any existing scripts - you must
  compile and import them all at once

* "Check where scripts are used"
  produces a list of all the places
  where your game triggers a script.

* "Find broken script triggers"
  searches for references to scripts
  that have been renamed or removed.
