The script management menu allows you to access some tasks and tools related to your Plotscripts. (Check the documentation wiki at http://HamsterRepublic.com/ohrrpgce/ if you want to learn more about plotscripting)

* "Compile and/or Import plotscripts
   (.hss/.hs)"
  Imports scripts. Provided HSpeak
  is where it's expected to be, it's
  not necessary anymore to manually
  compile your scripts using HSpeak.
  This overwrites any existing
  scripts - you must put them all in
  the same file (or 'include' them
  all in the same file) and import
  them all at once.

* "Export names for scripts (.hsi)"
  creates or updates a list of names
  (constants) that you can use while
  writing your scripts. This is
  typically necessary for writing
  your plotscripts.

* "Check where scripts are used"
  produces a list of all the places
  where your game triggers a script.

* "Find broken script triggers"
  searches for references to scripts
  that have been renamed or removed.

You can press F5 on this menu or on Custom's main menu to immediately recompile and reimport the last script file that you imported. (Note that scripts aren't reimported automatically by the Game runner when using `Test Game' live-previewing; you will have to press F5 in-game to reload scripts.)
