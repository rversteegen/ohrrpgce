This is the Password Editor.

Hm, well the screen says it all. Type in a password if you like, and press ENTER to confirm it.

NOTE: Pressing ESC also confirms your password, rather than cancelling it!  To cancel or remove a password, just delete it here with the BACKSPACE key.

If you forget your password, and it had actually been of some use for security, you would have been in trouble. Thankfully, the password feature does not really afford any extra "security", and if you ask one of the developers at the OHR wiki for help they can easily recover your password for you.
