You can use arrow keys or the mouse.

Left-Click on pixels to draw, (or press SPACE)
Right-Click to select a color from the tile (or press ENTER)

Left click on a color in the palette at the bottom to select it. (ALT + arrow keys will pick palette colors too!)

See the "Undo" bar along the right? Click there to cancel a change, or press CTRL+Z

Dang! no more room for details! I guess I better get cracking on help menu scrolling!
