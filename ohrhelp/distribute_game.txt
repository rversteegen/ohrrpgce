You can export your game as a convenient package that is easy to share with other people.

[.ZIP]
This is the most popular format for game developers. It is a simple zip file with a copy of your game, a renamed copy of game.exe that will automatically launch your game, plus all the support .dll files that a player will need to play your game without needing to install the OHRRPGCE

[Windows Installer]
This creates an easy-to-use setup installer that works on all major versions of Windows. This is good for sharing your game with casual players who don't know how to use zip files.

[Debian Linux Package]
This exports a package for any Linux distribution that uses .deb packages. This includes Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint, and others.
