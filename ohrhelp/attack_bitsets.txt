This is a list of attack bitsets - simple OFF or ON settings. Bitsets that are turned ON are highlighted.

Use the Up and Down arrow keys (or PgUp, PgDn, Home, and End) to navigate the list.

Modify bitsets with Left, Right, SPACE and ENTER.

* Cure Instead of Harm
When this bitset is on, the attack will cure the target stat instead of damaging it. (This works for any target stat, not just HP)

* Divide Spread Damage
When the attack is targeted to more than one target, this will divide the damage evenly between them.

* Absorb Damage
Any damage dealt will be added to the attacker. (This works for any target stat, not just HP.)

* Unreversable Picture
Normally, an attack picture will be flipped to match the direction the attacker is facing. This bitset makes the attack picture always appear unflipped, exactly as you drew it.

* Steal Item
Gives the attacker a chance to steal an item. (Only works for enemy targets. See the "Rewards" menu in the enemy editor.)

* Elemental Damage
Causes the attack to do elemental damage, which may result in more or less damage depending on the target's strengths and weaknesses. Multiple elemental bitsets can be combined. (If all the elemental bitsets are off, the attack counts as a "Physical" attack for spawning purposes.)

* Bonus vs Enemy Type
Causes the attack to do extra damage to any enemy that is a member of one of the enemy type groups. (See the enemy bitset editor)

* Fail vs Elemental resistance
Causes the attack to completely fail against any target who has a resistance to the given elementals.

* Fail vs Enemy Type
Causes the attack to completely fail against any enemy who is a member of one of the enemy type groups. (See the enemy bitset editor)

* Cannot target enemy slot
Prevents the attack from being targeted to enemies in certain slots.

* Cannot target hero slot
Prevents the attack from being targeted to heroes in certain slots.

* Ignore attacker's extra hits
Normally the attacker may repeat the attack several times according to their Extra Hits stat. Turning this bitset on makes sure that the attack is not repeated even if the attacker has extra hits.

* Erase rewards (Enemy target only)
When an enemy is hit with an attack that has this bitset turned on, its money, experience and items are deleted. Killing the enemy will not give any rewards at the end of battle.

* Show damage without inflicting
When this bitset is turned on, no damage will be done, but the amount of damage that would have been done will be displayed.

* Store Target
When an attack with this bitset is used, the attacker will memorize the target for later use with attacks that use the "Stored Target" target class.

* Delete Stored Target
When an attack with this bitset is used, the attacker will forget any previously stored target, and will no longer be able to use attacks that use "Stored Target" target class.

* Automatically choose target
Causes the attacker to automatically choose a target according to the attack's preferred target settings. This bitset is only useful for attacks used by heroes, since enemies always automatically choose targets regardless of this bitset.

* Show attack name
Causes the attack's name to be displayed alongside the attack's damage. (This can be used together with the "Do not display Damage" bitset if you want only the attack's name to be shown)

* Do not display Damage
Although the damage will still be dealt to the target, this bitset will prevent the damage from being displayed.

* Reset target stat to max before hit
Causes the target stat of the attack's target to be reset to maximum before any damage is dealt. This is most often used with attacks that change stats like strength or speed or defense to prevent the effect from stacking. This bitset is also useful for attacks that target the effect register, such as poison and stun.

* Allow Cure to exceed maximum
When used together with the "Cure instead of harm" bitset, this allows the target stat to be cured higher than its maximum. (All target stats except HP and MP will be reset to maximum when the battle ends)

* Useable Outside of Battle
Allows the attack to be used by heroes outside of battle, from the Spells menu. This is normally only used for curing attacks, but note that it also works for damaging attacks. (Some attack features like chaining do not work outside of battle)

* Damage MP (obsolete)
If the attack's target stat is HP, this bitset will change it to MP. This bitset only exists for backwards compatibility with old games from before different target stats were supported. For all new games you should use the target stat settings instead.

* Do not randomize
Normally damage is randomized plus or minus 20%. Turning this bitset on disables the randomization.

* Damage can be Zero
Normally the minimum amount of damage that an attack can do is 1. This bitset allows damage to be 0.

* Cause heroes to run away
If this bitset is turned on, the attack will cause the heroes to run away. This can be used in combination with the general bitset "Disable ESC to run from battle" if you are implementing your own alternate running-away system.

* Mutable
If this bitset is turned on, this attack will be disabled for anyone with a damaged Mute register.

* Fail if target is poisoned
The attack will fail on any target with a damaged poison register

* Fail if target is regened
The attack will fail on any target with a damaged regen register

* Fail if target is stunned
The attack will fail on any target with a damaged stun register

* Fail if target is muted
The attack will fail on any target with a damaged mute register

* % based attacks damage instead of set
This bitset only affects attacks with percentage damage math. The percentage will be used as damage instead of setting the target stat to a percentage of its maximum value.

* Check costs when used as a weapon
This bitset only matters for attacks that are assigned to weapon items. Normally weapon attacks can always be used regardless of whether or not the attacker has enough MP, or enough items to satisfy the item cost. This bitset causes weapon attacks to be disabled when the attacker cannot afford them, just like attacks in spell lists.

* Do not chain if attack fails
This causes the attack's chain to be ignored if the attack fails. Normally chains can continue even if the attack fails.

* Reset Poison register
This causes the target's poison register to be reset to an undamaged state. This is convenient for making attacks that cure poison.

* Reset Regen register
This causes the target's regen register to be reset to an undamaged state. This is convenient for making attacks that stop regen.

* Reset Stun register
This causes the target's stun register to be reset to an undamaged state. This is convenient for making attacks that wake stunned targets.

* Reset Mute register
This causes the target's mute register to be reset to an undamaged state. This is convenient for making attacks that unmute muted targets.

* Cancel target's attack
If a target is hit with an attack that has this bitset turned on, any attack that the target has already chosen to use will be interrupted, and they will lose a turn.

* Can't be canceled by other attacks
This bitset is used to make attacks which cannot be interrupted by other attacks with the "Cancel target's attack" bitset.

* Do not trigger spawning on hit
When this bitset is turned on, the attack will not trigger the target's hit spawning.

* Do not trigger spawning on kill
When this bitset is turned on, if the attack kills the target it will not trigger death spawning.

* Check costs when used as an item
This bitset only matters for attacks that are done when an item is used from the Items menu in battle. Normally item attacks can always be used regardless of whether or not the attacker has enough MP, or enough items to satisfy the item cost. This bitset causes weapon attacks to be disabled when the attacker cannot afford them, just like attacks in spell lists.

* Re-check costs after attack delay
If this bitset is turned on, the attack will fail if the attacker does not have enough MP or items at the moment when the attack is executed. This can happen if they are hit with an MP-draining attack while they are preparing to cast a spell, or if another character uses up an item that they were trying to use.

* Do not cause target to flinch
Normally the target of an attack flinches. For heroes this is their "Hurt" frame, and for enemies this is a small horizontal twitch. This bitset prevents the flinching.

* Don't allow damage to exceed target stat
This bitset prevents the attack from doing any more damage than the target's target stat. For example, if an attack is capable of doing 100 damage, but the target only has 25 HP left, this bitset would limit the damage to 25. This also works for curing attacks. For example, if a cure spell can restore 100 HP, but the target is only 25 HP below max, this bitset will limit the cure to 25 HP. (This bitset also works for other target stats besides HP)

* Delay doesn't block further actions
This bitset means the attacker will start their next turn immediately without waiting for the attack delay to run out. These non-blocking attacks don't interfere with the attacker's ready-meter. (non-blocking is a automatically inherited by attacks that chain from a non-blocking attack)
