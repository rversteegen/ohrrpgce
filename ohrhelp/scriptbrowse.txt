This is the script browser. It shows a list of all the plotscripts that you have imported into your game.

Use the Up and Down arrow keys (or PgUp, PgDn, Home, and End) to navigate the list, and press ENTER or SPACE to choose a script.

If some of your scripts have a number at the beginning of their names, that is because they are "old style" scripts.

See the OHRRPGCE wiki for more information about scripts.
