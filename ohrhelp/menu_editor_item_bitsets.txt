This is a list of bitsets specific to a menu item - simple OFF or ON settings. Bitsets that are turned ON are highlighted.

Use the Up and Down arrow keys (or PgUp, PgDn, Home, and End) to navigate the list.

Modifiy bitsets with Left, Right, SPACE and ENTER.

There are two bitsets:

*"Hide if disabled" - This causes the menu item to completely vanish from the menu if it has been disabled by tags or if it is a "Special" type menu item that is not allowed on the current map. Otherwise the menu item will still appear but will be greyed out and unable to be selected.

*"Close menu if selected" - This causes the menu to be closed after the menu item is selected. It is often useful with menu items in menus that have the "allow gameplay & scripts" bitset turned OFF, since text boxes and scripts triggered by menu items will wait for the menu to close.
