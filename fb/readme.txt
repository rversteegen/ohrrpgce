fb_string.h, fb_device.h, fb_file.h are taken from the source to FreeBASIC 0.21.1's rtlib, with some declarations commented out.
fb_config.h is taken from FB pre-0.91.0 (Jan 9th 2014)
fb_stub.h is a modified, shortened version of fb.h which doesn't depend on any of the platform-specific headers.

These headers are slightly out of date already, but the idea is to only depend on a couple things in them.
