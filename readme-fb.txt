OHRFB - OHRRPGCE FreeBasic version - Game Player

2005-10-18 - Aristotle
-----------------------------------------------------------

This is the first proper release of the Windows version,
and there will probably be a few issues.

ALT-ENTER switches between fullscreen and windowed modes.

Music is converted to MIDI and played with the external
FMOD EX library. The DLL should be included with exe
distributions. The conversion might not always be a
good match, and the final infinite loop will always go
to the start of the file instead of any other loop point.

Browsing has a couple of problems at the top levels. Run
game.exe from the same drive as your games and don't 
store the games in the root folder.

This should be in line with the Rusalka release of the
official version.

Please see the documentation of the official version for
further details. It can be obtained from
